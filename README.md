Group: IT-2209
Group Members: Aiteni Tolegen, Ilham Assimov, Erniyaz Ashuov

## Proposal:

Our proposal outlines the utilization of machine learning for skin cancer recognition, with a specific focus on its application within Kazakhstan. Recognizing the importance of early detection in cancer management, our project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of providing preliminary skin cancer screening.

## Background:

Cancer stands as a significant health concern in Kazakhstan, with skin cancer being one of the prominent types. Leveraging modern technologies such as machine learning offers promising avenues for enhancing early detection, which is crucial for effective treatment. We draw upon research from sources like the "Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention" and data provided by the World Health Organization to highlight the pressing need for innovative approaches to combat skin cancer in Kazakhstan.

## Implemented Solutions:

We have successfully implemented a machine learning model using TensorFlow in Google Colab for skin cancer detection from images. Our model integrates various libraries including Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib for efficient data manipulation and visualization. Leveraging advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques, we have achieved accurate detection of skin cancer lesions.

## Data Acquisition:

For our project, we utilized the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, which offers a vast collection of skin lesion images essential for training and validating our machine learning model. The dataset's diversity in skin types, conditions, and lesions ensures the robustness and reliability of our model.

## Proposed Solution:

Our proposed solution involves the integration of our machine learning model into a user-friendly web application. This application will allow users to upload skin photos for instant cancer analysis, thereby making skin cancer screening more accessible and efficient. We aim to further enhance the application's capabilities to potentially diagnose other skin diseases, thus extending its utility.

## Tech Stack:

Our project utilizes Python for data processing and model development, along with TensorFlow for building and training the machine learning model. We employ JavaScript/Flask for web application development, enabling seamless interaction with users. Additionally, OpenCV is used for image processing, ensuring accurate analysis of skin images.

## Accomplishments:

- Successfully developed and trained a machine learning model for skin cancer recognition.
- Integrated various libraries and technologies to enhance model performance and usability.
- Utilized the ISIC dataset for comprehensive training and validation of our model.

## Next Steps:

- Further refinement of the machine learning model for improved accuracy and efficiency.
- Integration of the model into a web application interface for user accessibility.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of the model to adapt to emerging data and trends in skin cancer recognition.
