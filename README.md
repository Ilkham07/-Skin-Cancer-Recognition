# Skin Cancer Recognition

## Problem Description:

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for skin cancer recognition, focusing on its impact in Kazakhstan. Early detection is vital for effective treatment, and this model aims to provide a reliable tool for preliminary screening.

## Background Information:

Cancer is a major concern in Kazakhstan, with skin cancer being prevalent. Innovative solutions like machine learning offer promising ways to enhance early detection, crucial for effective treatment.

## Available Solutions

Advanced technologies such as DermaSensor and MIT's AI Tool for Melanoma Detection provide efficient skin cancer detection methods.

## Data Acquisition:

We'll use the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, containing over 20,000 to 30,000 skin lesion images, for training our model.

## Solution Description:

We're developing a TensorFlow-based machine learning model in Google Colab to detect skin cancer from images. This model will be integrated into a web application for easy cancer analysis.

## Tech Stack:

- **Python**: For data processing and model development.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib for data manipulation.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **JavaScript/Flask**: For web application development.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.

## Additional Information:

Our project will utilize photographic data with key details like age, diagnosis, and image type. This approach aims to improve the accuracy of skin cancer detection.
